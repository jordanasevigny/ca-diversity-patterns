Sample Process
1.4.5
Sample barcodes were recorded and assigned a corresponding lysate tube. Sample filters, lysis buffer,and proteinase K were heated to 56 C for one hour. Under a laminar flow hood, warm lysis buffers were pushed through the filter housing, and all supernatant was collected in the corresponding lysate tube. Tubes were placed in an incubator overnight at 56 C. After incubation the lysate tubes were immediately processed.


Extraction
2.6.1
Genomic DNA from samples was extracted using the Omega Biotek Mag-Bind Blood & Tissue DNA HDQ 96 Kit (4x96 Preps) (Cat. No. / ID: M6399-01) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Whole (25mm or 47mm) filters were used for genomic DNA extraction. The extraction protocol was automated and completed using a Hamilton Microlab Starlet. Genomic DNA was eluted into 100 µl and frozen at -20 C.


PCR

Forward Primer: GTCGGTAAAACTCGTGCCAGC

Reverse Primer: CATAGTGGGGTATCTAATCCCAGTTTG

Primer notes: 

Primer reference: Miya et al 2015

Portions of hyper-variable regions of the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were PCR amplified from each genomic DNA sample using the MiFishUF and MiFishUR primers with spacer regions. Both forward and reverse primers also contained a 5’ adaptor sequence to allow for subsequent indexing and Illumina sequencing. PCR amplification was performed in replicates of six and all six replicates were not pooled and kept separate. Each 25 µL PCR reaction was mixed according to the Promega PCR Master Mix specifications (Promega catalog # M5133, Madison, WI) which included 12.5ul Master Mix, 0.5 µM of each primer, 1.0 µl of gDNA, and 10.5 µl DNase/RNase-free H2O. DNA was PCR amplified using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95C for 3 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 20 seconds at 98C, 30 seconds at 60C, and 30 seconds at 72C, and a final elongation at 72C for 10 minutes. Added 11/2019.


Gel
4.1.1
To determine amplicon size and PCR efficiency, each reaction was visually inspected using a 2% agarose gel with 5µl of each sample as input. 


PCR Amplicon Cleanup
5.1.1
Amplicons were then cleaned by incubating amplicons with Exo1/SAP for 30 minutes at 37C following by inactivation at 95C for 5 minutes and stored at -20C. 


Barcoding PCR
6.2.1
A second round of PCR was performed to complete the sequencing library construct, appending the final Illumina sequencing adapters and integrating sample-specific, dual index sequences (2 x 10bp). The indexing PCR included Promega Master mix, 0.5 µM of each primer and 2 µl of template DNA (cleaned amplicon from the first PCR reaction) and consisted of an initial denaturation of 95 °C for 3 minutes followed by 8 cycles of  95 °C for 30 sec, 55 °C for 30 seconds and 72 °C for 30 seconds. 


PCR Normal Pool
8.2.1
Final indexed amplicons from each sample were cleaned and normalized using mag-bind normalization. A 15µl aliquot of PCR amplicon was purified and normalized using Cytiva SpeedBead magnetic carboxylate modified particles (#45152105050250). Samples were then pooled together by adding 5µl of each normalized sample to the pool.


Sequencing
9.9.1
Sample library pools were prepped for sequencing on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION (Oxford, England) using the Ligation Sequencing Kit V14 (cat# SQK-LSK114). Final basecalling was completed using AWS Batch and EC2 g5.xlarge instances running ONT's dorado software (v0.7.1) in super high accuracy mode using the dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v5.0.0 basecalling model.


Bioinformatics
10.11.3
Raw Nanopore sequencing output was converted from pod5 to fastq format using dorado v0.7.1 [1] and the super-high accuracy basecalling model. Cutadapt v3.4 [2] was then used to trim outer adapters and reorient reads in a consistent 5’ to 3’ direction. The resulting reads were sorted into individual samples by demultiplexing with pheniqs v2.1.0 [3], allowing no more that one mismatch in each of the paired 10 bp molecular indices. Cutadapt was then used again to extract the target amplicon by removing the gene primers, discarding any reads where one or both primers were not found or where the resulting amplicon sequences were < 130 bp or > 210 bp. Exact sequence variants (ESVs) were then identified for each sample using the unoise3 denoising algorithm [4] as implemented in vsearch [5]. Only reads that were observed 4 or more times and with a maximum expected error rate [6] > 1 bp were considered as candidate ESVs and putative chimeras were filtered using the uchime3 algorithm [7]. Final read counts were determined for each sample by mapping unfiltered raw reads to the identified ESVs using the vsearch function usearch_global with an minimum identity of 95%. For each final ESV, a consensus taxonomy was assigned using a custom best-hits algorithm and a reference database consisting of publicly available sequences on NCBI GenBank [8], as well as Jonah Ventures voucher sequences records. Reference database searching used vsearch to conduct exhaustive semi-global pairwise alignments, and final match quality was quantified using a custom, query-centric approach, where the % match ignores terminal gaps in the target sequence, but not the query sequence. A consensus taxonomic assignment was then generated using either all 100% matching reference sequences or all reference sequences within 1% of the top match, accepting the reference taxonomy for any taxonomic level with > 90% agreement across the top hits.
